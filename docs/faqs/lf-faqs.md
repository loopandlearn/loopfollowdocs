Pro Tip:  If you are experiencing audible and visible glucose alerts every single minute, disable the *LoopFollow*, Settings, General Settings, Persistent Notifications slider. This is completely different from the persistent notifications that you might want enabled to see the APNS messages returned from real-time responses to remote command.
