## Initial Configuration

After you build *LoopFollow* the first time, you are asked a few questions (your initial choices can always be modified later):

* **Calendar Access**: if you want to allow *LoopFollow* to provide real-time updates to carplay using the Calendar, choose **Allow Full Access**
* **Bluetooth Access**: if you want to use an expired Dexcom sensor or a spare RileyLink device to keep *LoopFollow* running in the background while your phone is locked, choose **Allow**
* **Notifications**: if you want *LoopFollow* to notify you for any of your alarms or if *LoopFollow* stops working, choose **Allow**

You will then be presented with a blank home screen as shown below.

### *LoopFollow* Data Source

> Make sure you have access to the internet when filling out credentials.

You provide *LoopFollow* with information about the person you are following. At least one of these must be entered:

* [*Nightscout* URL](#add-nightscout)
* [*Dexcom* Share credentials](#add-dexcom)

#### Add *Nightscout*

The graphic below shows the display when you tap on the *Nightscout* Settings row. For more information about tokens, keep reading the details below the graphic.

!!! tip "Setting up a Second Device for Remote Control"
    With version 4.0 and newer, you can set up a second device with all the Nightscout and Remote Control Settings by scanning a QR code from a LoopFollow device that is already configured. 
    
    * See this section [Import from QR Code](../remote/remote-control-overview.md#import-from-qr-code){: target="_blank" }.

    Do **not** use that option if the person using the second device only needs to monitor with LoopFollow.

When adding the Nightscout information to monitor, you can copy your *Nightscout* URL (including the token) from the [Admin Tools in *Nightscout*](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/admin_tools/#subjects-and-roles). When pasted into *LoopFollow* URL row, the app will automatically extract and fill in both the URL and token.

![enter nightscout credentials](img/lf-data-source-ns.svg){width="300"}
{align="center"}

!!! tip "*Nightscout* Access"
    It is possible to have your *Nightscout* site readable by the world, in which case you do not need to add a token. If you choose to do that, just ignore references to entering the token. The status will show up as `OK (Read)`.

    For more information about tokens with *Nightscout*, refer to [Admin Tools in *Nightscout*](https://nightscout.github.io/nightscout/admin_tools/#subjects-and-roles).

The type of token depends on the type of remote control desired. 
The table below indicates the minimum token access for each type of remote control available with *LoopFollow*. 
When you enter your credentials, *LoopFollow* tries to reach the site and then provides the status. 

* The *Loop* Remote Control option requires *LoopFollow* version 3.2 or newer
* The *Trio* Remote Control option requires the user be on version 0.5.x or newer of Trio
    * **Breaking change** on 2025-October-06
    * *Trio* 0.6 or newer requires *LoopFollow* 4.0 or newer
    * *Trio* 0.5.1.28 or older requires *LoopFollow* 3.2.11 or older

| *LoopFollow* Remote Type | Minimum Token Access| *LoopFollow* Status |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **None** | Read | OK (Read) |
| ***Loop* Remote Control**| Read | OK (Read) |
| ***Trio* Remote Control**| Read | OK (Read) |
| ***Nightscout***<br>Trio 0.2 or older | Read & Careportal | OK (Read & Write) |

#### Add *Dexcom*

The graphic below shows the display when you tap on the *Dexcom* Settings row.

> The *Dexcom* Share credentials are optional, but can be useful when the *Nightscout* URL is unavailable.

#### `Rec. Bolus`

!!! warning "LoopFollow Report of Trio Recommended Dose"
    It happens. We made a mistake. The `Rec. Bolus` feature for *LoopFollow* was reporting a value from the *Trio* app that was never meant to be used as a recommended bolus. 
    
    * With `LoopFollow` 4.0 and newer, users viewing a *Trio* URL will notice the `Rec. Bolus` display is always blank
        * Updates are planned for *Trio* and *LoopFollow* to provide the last recommended value from the *Trio* app
    * The value shown to users viewing a *Loop* URL matches what the user of the *Loop* phone would see when asking for a recommendation and is not changed in `LoopFollow` 4.0
    
    **Remember: the `Rec. Bolus` values is from the last AID app update to Nightscout**
    

### Remote Settings

Detailed instructions for configuring a phone for remote control are found on the [Remote Control Overview](../remote/remote-control-overview.md){: target="_blank" } page.

If you are configuring a second device and already have one device configured for remote control, be sure to review:

### Calendar

The calendar entry used to update on the watch in real time, but with iOS 18, the update rate has been throttled. 
It is still useful for Carplay.

### Contact

The Contact image trick added with v2.2.8 currently works to provide real-time updates on an Apple Watch.

## Logging

LoopFollow logs activity to a file that can be viewed within the app, and can be shared via email, a Notes file or Facebook messenger if needed.  The log can be filtered and searched. This will aid in troubleshooting and diagnostics. 
Normally, the debug log option is disabled. The log debug option is found in the Advanced Settings section. If the logs seem verbose, check that setting.
