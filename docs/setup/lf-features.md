## *LoopFollow* Features

Most features are self-explanatory. Use the [Settings Screen](lf-setup.md#settings-screen){: target="_blank" } to navigate to the appropriate section to adjust the app settings.

Some features require more explanation.

## Toolbar Tab Customization

The toolbar or tab bar at the bottom of the *LoopFollow* screen is used for rapid access to specific features. This navigation feature can support up to 5 tabs, but there are 6 options that could be placed there. With version 3.1 and newer, the tabs displayed are customizable.

??? tip "Historical Tabs (Click to open/close)"
    Historically the 5 tabs were:

    * tab 1: Home
    * tab 2: Alarms or Remote Control
    * tab 3: Snoozer
    * tab 4: Nightscout site
    * tab 5: Settings

    The updated design is that tabs 2 and 4 are optional and tab 5 can be either settings or the &hellip;&nbsp;More icon.

The new arrangement is:

* tab 1: Home
* tab 2: Configurable
* tab 3: Snoozer
* tab 4: Configurable
* tab 5: Configurable (Settings or &hellip;&nbsp;More)

### Instructions for Tab Selection

After choosing the Tab Selection row from *LoopFollow* Settings, these tab options can be placed as desired in your choice of tab 2, tab 4, the &hellip;&nbsp;More Menu or Hidden. 

* Alarms
* Remote
* Nightscout site

> If you tap cancel in upper left - no changes are saved. 

> Once you tap `Apply` in upper right, your toolbar is updated.

## Background Refresh Settings

*LoopFollow* has traditionally provided an option to play a silent audio as a trick to allow it to wake up when in the background or when the phone is locked. This has several drawbacks including battery drain and limited reliability.

With *LoopFollow* version 2.2.9 or newer, an additional method is provided using an external device to provide a heartbeat. This can be a radiolink device, if you have one available, or a used Dexcom Transmitter (G5/ G6/ ONE/ Anubis) or Sensor (G7/ ONE+). The batteries on Dexcom devices continue to provide power to the Bluetooth system, giving a heartbeat at about 5 minute intervals. The radiolink devices provide a heartbeat every minute.

### Bluetooth Heartbeat

#### Why was this added?

*LoopFollow* can use a background silent audio to keep iOS from killing the app, but this trick puts an extra load on the phone battery and it is known to stop working in some cases, such as when using a Timer on your phone

* If the silent tune is working well for you, there’s no need to change
* If you’ve been experiencing significant battery drain you may want to use a Bluetooth Heartbeat

#### How does it work?

* You can choose to use a radiolink device or an expired Dexcom device as a heartbeat
* This can save significantly on the battery used by *LoopFollow* and provides more reliable ability to wake up *LoopFollow* out of background mode to check for alarm status.

#### What devices are supported?

These devices can provide a constant Bluetooth connection for your *LoopFollow* phone:

* Radiolink:  RileyLink, OrangeLink,  Emalink
* Dexcom Device (the battery can last for months after it is no longer in service with a sensor)
    * Dexcom G5/G6/ONE/Anubis transmitter
    * Dexcom G7/ONE+ sensor

If you use *LoopFollow* on your Looping phone for the features offered, you can connect to your own Dexcom device. You don’t need to use an expired device in addition.

#### How do I configure Bluetooth Heartbeat?

These graphics walk you through how to select the Background Refresh Type.  The example shows the steps if you choose to use a Dexcom Device (G5/G6/ONE/G7/ONE+). A similar process is used for a radiolink device.

If the person using *LoopFollow* is also wearing a Dexcom or radiolink, they should choose their own device. The RSSI is a measure of the strength of the signal. It is normal for the Dexcom device to disconnect. It will reconnect regularly.

Features include:

* Options for delta value or arrow
* Dynamic font size

### Step-by-Step Instructions

It is probably easiest to view the video for Set Up *LoopFollow* Contact Complication on Your Apple Watch, but a bullet list is also provided below

    * On your iPhone, open the Watch app
    * Tap “My Watch” at the bottom, if it isn’t already selected
3. Choose a Watch Face
