## Remote Control of the *Loop* App

This option is available for remote control of a *Loop* phone when you build the `dev` branch of *LoopFollow*. After testing and release, this will replace [Nightscout Remote Control for Loop](remote-control-nightscout.md#loopfollow--careportal-with-the-loop-app).

* *Loop* Remote Control
    * Remote control with *LoopFollow* includes adding remote carbs, enacting remote bolus, and starting and canceling Overrides
    * Available with all versions of *Loop* 3
    * Requires *LoopFollow* `dev` branch (once released, the version will be 3.2 or newer)


* After you [Configure *LoopFollow* for Remote Control](#configure-loopfollow-for-remote-control)
* You can [Use *LoopFollow* *Loop* Remote Control](#use-loopfollow-loop-remote-control)
* Be sure to read [FAQs for Remote Commands](#faqs-for-remote-commands)

## Use *LoopFollow* *Loop* Remote Control

Once the *LoopFollow* phone is [configured](#configure-for-remote-control), and while the *Loop* phone is handy, test sending Remote Commands. It is good to also have a browser open with the *Nightscout* URL displayed.

### Remote Sequence Steps

!!! tip "Wait for the Result"

    The remote control sequence requires several steps:

    1. *LoopFollow* device to *Apple Push Notifications*
        * If that interchange is successful, you get a success message in *LoopFollow*
        * If that interchange fails, you get an immediate message with the failure reason
    1. *Apple Push Notifications* to *Loop* phone
    1. The *Loop* app processes the remote command and either **enacts** it or **rejects** it
    1. The *Loop* app uploads to *Nightscout* with result shown on *LoopFollow* main screen in a few minutes
        * If the remote request was **enacted**, the result is visible on the *LoopFollow* main plot
        * If the remote request was **rejected**, a gray dot is visible on the *LoopFollow* main plot - touch it to see the reason why the request was rejected

    > If no result shows up at *LoopFollow* (no gray dot, no response to remote request), then it is most likely step 2 that failed. We have limited control over that.

!!! tip "Make sure *Loop* information is up to date"
    The insulin amount is filled out with the last recommended bolus that *LoopFollow* downloaded from the *Nightscout* site, which in turn was uploaded from the *Loop* phone.

    Read the warning in the Remote Bolus screen and make sure the Insulin Amount value is recent.

    If the last update was more than 12 minutes ago, that line is not prefilled.

## FAQs for Remote Commands

1. **If I follow more than one person with *LoopFollow*, do I need multiple APNs Keys?**  
   **Answer**: No. If you support multiple people, you only need one APNS key.

    * You can follow someone who is using the *Trio* app and another person who is using the *Loop* app. 
    * You enter the same APNS credentials for each instance of *LoopFollow* that you are using for your multiple loopers.

1. **How can I tell if it worked?**  
   **Answer**: You will get an immediate response on *LoopFollow* whether it successfully sent an APNS command. 
   
    * It is still possible that the command won't go through to the *loop* phone - so wait until you see the remote entry on the *LoopFollow* display
    * If the command was sent but there was an error, you will see a gray dot on the *LoopFollow* plot instead of the desired remote entry. If you tap on the gray dot, the error message will be displayed.

### FAQs on Remote Overrides

Don't forget to read [*Loopdocs*: Overrides](https://loopkit.github.io/loopdocs/operation/features/overrides/). 

For remote overrides in particular:

1. **Can I set a different override in *LoopFollow* than I have programmed into&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;app?**  
   **Answer**: No. You will only be able to enact override presets already programmed into the *Loop* app.

1. **If I didn't start the override in *LoopFollow* (it was started in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;itself), can I still use *LoopFollow* to cancel it?**  
   **Answer**: Yes. You can cancel an override set in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;with *LoopFollow*.

1. **Can I replace an override set in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;with an override set in *LoopFollow*?**  
   **Answer**: Yes.

1. **Can I see on *LoopFollow* when a temporary override has been set using the looper‚Äôs phone?**  
   **Answer**: Yes. 
   
    * There will be a green bar on the *LoopFollow* display within a few minutes. 
    * Once you see the bar, you can tap on Remote, Overrides to view the active override
        * If it is a named preset (override), the name is listed at the top of the screen in the Active Override row
        * If you want to see the details, you may need to scroll down to find that override in the list
        * A custom override (not named) shows up as "Custom Override" in the Active Override row - the details can be observed in the Information Table on the main *LoopFollow* screen
    * The values set for the override may take up to 5 minutes to appear in the Information Table Display, at which time the %insulin needs and target are shown.

1. **Can a looper cancel a remote override**?  
   **Answer**: Yes. They can tap the heart icon <font color="blue">:fontawesome-solid-heart-pulse:</font> in&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;so that it is no longer highlighted. This turns off the override, regardless of where it was initiated.

1. **I set a remote override in *LoopFollow* but the Looper tapped the heart symbol <font color="blue">:fontawesome-solid-heart-pulse:</font> in the *Loop* app, so the override turned off. Will the override get reinstated  the next time&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;completes with internet access?**  
   **Answer**: No. The *APN* is only sent once. You can set the remote override again if need be.

1. **Can I schedule a remote override ahead of time using Nightscout?**    
   **Answer**: No. When you set a remote override in *LoopFollow*, it starts immediately and lasts for the duration programmed for that override in the *Loop* app. You can only set an override in advance using the *Loop* app.

### Warnings on Remote Commands

!!! danger "**Duplicate Delivery Risk**"
    We want to highlight a very important risk before you get started.

    For safety, always assume a previous remote carbs/bolus was delivered. For motivation think of the following example:
    
    * You send a 5-unit remote bolus.
    * The bolus is delivered to the Looper.
    * *Nightscout* is having a temporary technical issue and doesn't show the bolus was received.
    * The *LoopFollow* display echoes what is shown in the *Nightscout* so you don‚Äôt see a delivery and you assume it failed.
    * You send another remote 5-unit bolus.
    * The second 5-unit bolus is delivered to the Looper (10 Units total).

You can see the danger of sending duplicate bolus/carbs so be careful. If a remote bolus/carb entry doesn‚Äôt show in *Nightscout* or *LoopFollow*, use your own judgment on whether enough time has passed to try again.

### Remote Bolus, Then Remote Carb

!!! warning "If sending both, choose Bolus then Carbs"
    If you plan to send a carb command remotely and later decide to issue a bolus command - STOP and consider.

    There are 2 scenarios of concern that could lead to too much insulin:
    
    * Dosing Strategy is **Temp Basal Only** (temporary basal)
        * _<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;will initiate a max Temp Basal when it receives the carbs remote command
        * Your bolus is accepted next and takes place in addition to the high temporary basal
    * Dosing Strategy is **Automatic Bolus** 
        * _<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;will initiate a percentage of the recommended dose when it receives the carbs remote command
        * Your bolus will be accepted and take place in addition to an automatic boluses or be rejected because a bolus is already in progress
    
    Typically, sending a remote carb entry alone is sufficient for&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;to know about the carbs and begin to dose for them.
    
    If you really want to both bolus for carbs and enter carbs, then do it in that order.
    
    1. The bolus, when accepted, may start a zero Temp Basal (temporary basal) (which is "safer")
    2. The carbs, when accepted, will cause the app to respond to the carbs
    3. In this case, the prediction includes both carbs and bolus
    
    ‚ùóÔ∏è Remember - you must wait pause at least 30 seconds between remote commands or the One-Time-Password (OTP) will be rejected as having already been used.

     ‚ùóÔ∏è *Apple* can decide to limit the number of APNS commands it services. Make your remote requests count.

## Configure *LoopFollow* for Remote Control

### *LoopFollow* Remote Setting Type 

The Remote Settings row in the *LoopFollow* Settings screen is used to select the type of remote access you wish to use.

![LoopFollow remote settings type](img/lf-lrc-selection.png){width="300"}
{align="center"}

!!! question "The *Loop* Remote Control option is not available"
    The `Loop Remote Control` option is only available in *LoopFollow* if you have already entered a [*Nightscout* URL](#add-nightscout) with a default profile recognized as a *Loop* profile. 

### Guardrails

The maximum allowed entries for Bolus and Carbs are configured in the guardrails section. The default values are shown in the graphic below. Adjust this to what is appropriate for the individual.

![default guardrails](img/lf-lrc-guardrails.png){width="300"}
{align=center}

These guardrails are for sending remote commands with *LoopFollow*. There are separate guardrails in the *Loop* app itself. Be sure the *LoopFollow* guardrails are at least as conservative as the *Loop* guardrails.

!!! warning "Do not exceed *Loop* Guardrails"
    Example:

    * *LoopFollow* guardrail is 10 U bolus
    * *Loop* guardrail is 8 U bolus
    * Send remote bolus amount of 10 U from *LoopFollow*
        * *LoopFollow* shows a success message, meaning the APNS request was successfully sent to the *Loop* phone
        * The *Loop* phone rejects the request because it exceeds the guardrail
        * A gray dot shows up on the *LoopFollow* screen, tapping it shows the message "Exceeds Maximum allowed bolus in settings"


### Credentials to Enable Loop Remote Control

When you select *Loop* Remote Control as the Remote Type in the *LoopFollow* app, you must fill in the (1) [Developer Team ID](#developer-team-id), (2) [APNS Key ID](#apns-key-id) and (3) [APNS Key](#apns-key).

![remote lrc settings ](img/lf-lrc-credentials.png){width="300"}
{align="center"}

### Developer Team ID

This is the *Apple* Developer ID for whoever created the APNS Key. The developer must be the same as the developer who built the *Loop* app.

Note that the *Nightscout* app and the *LoopFollow* app do not need to be built by this developer. It is only the *Loop* app that has this requirement.

### APNS Key ID

If you previously configured remote control with the *Loop* app, you already have an *Apple* Push Notification System (APNS) Key ID and Key. These were added to the config vars in your *Nightscout* site. See [Existing APNS](#existing-apns){: target="_blank" }. The value of the `LOOP_APNS_KEY_ID` goes here. 

If you have never created an APNS (or have lost the credentials), follow the directions in [New APNS](#new-apns){: target="_blank" } and copy the APNS Key ID into *LoopFollow* and save the value in your Secrets Reference file.

The APNS Key ID and APNS Key only need to be added to *LoopFollow* to enable *Loop* Remote Control. They do not need to be added to the *Nightscout* site if they are not already there. However, if you plan to use *Nightscout* `Careportal` or *LoopCaregiver*, then the APNS `config` vars must be added to *Nightscout*.

> When creating the APNS, you must be logged in as a developer. The developer ID for the APNS must be the same as the one used for creating your *Loop* app or remote control will not work.

### APNS Key

If you previously configured remote control with the *Loop* app, you already have an *Apple* Push Notification System (APNS) Key ID and Key. These were added to the config vars in your *Nightscout* site. See [Existing APNS](#existing-apns){: target="_blank" }. The value of the `LOOP_APNS_KEY` goes here.

If you have never created an APNS (or have lost the credentials), follow the directions in [New APNS](#new-apns){: target="_blank" } and copy the APNS Key into *LoopFollow* and save the value in your Secrets Reference file.

### QR Code URL

This provides the One-Time Password needed for the *Loop* app to accept the APNS input as valid.

On the&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;phone, *Nightscout* must be included under the `Loop` -> Settings -> Services section. Navigate to Services and select *Nightscout*. Tap on the One-Time Password row to view the QR code.

When you need to configure your authentication method, you can either use a saved QR screenshot or scan the QR on the&nbsp;_<span translate="no">Loop</span>_&nbsp;phone.

Options:

* Have your Looper (or at least their phone) available
* Save a screenshot of their QR code
    * Keep this secure
    * Do not share the QR screenshot when asking for help

![example screen for nightscout and qr code](img/qr-code-example.png ){width="650"}
{align="center"}

While you are on the *Loop* Settings -> Services -> NightScout screen, notice that the 6-digit number on the One-Time Password row updates every 30 seconds.

### Environment Production

If the *Loop* app was built with Browser Build, you must enable this row.

If the *Loop* app was built using Xcode on a Mac, you must disable this row.

### Debug / Info

This section indicates if *Loop* has uploaded required information to *Nightscout*.

The graphic below shows a properly configured *LoopFollow* when the *Loop* app was built using the Browser Build method.
