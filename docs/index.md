## *LoopFollow* 

*LoopFollow* is an open-source DIY (do-it-yourself) app that displays information for a person with diabetes in an easy-to-use interface. 
It combines information from multiple other apps and provides custom alerts. It runs on iPhone, iPad or Mac devices. With newer versions, some remote control features are available for the *Loop* and *Trio* apps.

*LoopFollow* was created because using different apps as a parent or caregiver of a person with diabetes can be cumbersome. 
Add in the extra details from looping with an Open Source Automated Insulin Delivery (OS AID) app 
and flipping back and forth between various sources of information can be a challenge. 
Many loopers use *LoopFollow* for themselves because of the flexible (and loud) alarm options.

*LoopFollow*:

* Displays information from a Nightscout URL or Dexcom Share account
* Provides flexible alarm features with a Snooze screen
* Supports *Loop* and *Trio* OS AID systems and provides remote control features
* Supports up to 3 loopers – each with their own unique app name
* Works with your Apple Watch
* Runs on an iPhone, iPad or a Mac computer
